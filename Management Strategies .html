Management Strategies
Resistant Varieties: Use sugarcane varieties that are resistant or tolerant to specific diseases prevalent in your area.

Crop Rotation: Rotate sugarcane with other crops to reduce the buildup of pathogens in the soil.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected plant material to reduce the spread of diseases.

Fungicides/Bactericides: Apply appropriate chemicals as a preventive or curative measure, following recommended guidelines.

Proper Irrigation and Drainage: Ensure proper water management to avoid conditions that favor pathogen growth, such as excessive moisture.

Monitoring: Regularly inspect sugarcane fields for early signs of disease to implement control measures promptly.

Identifying the specific disease affecting your sugarcane is crucial for effective management.
If you suspect a problem, you might want to consult with a local agricultural extension officer or plant pathologist for precise diagnosis and recommendations.
