# Sugarcan-Leaf-Disease
Sugarcane leaf diseases can be a significant issue in sugarcane cultivation, impacting both yield and quality.
Several pathogens can affect sugarcane leaves, leading to various symptoms and problems.

# Hereâ€™s an overview of some common leaf diseases in sugarcane:
# Common Sugarcane Leaf Diseases
1- Red Rot:
    Cause: Typically caused by the fungus Colletotrichum falcatum.
    Symptoms: Red lesions on leaves, leading to premature leaf death. The disease can also affect the stalk and reduce sugar content.

2- Leaf Scald:
    Cause: Caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas albilineans.
    Symptoms: Long, narrow, yellowish lesions that eventually turn brown and dry out. Affected leaves may show a scorched appearance.

3- Sugarcane Rust:
    Cause: Caused by the fungus Puccinia melanocephala.
    Symptoms: Orange-brown pustules (rust) on the underside of leaves. Can lead to reduced photosynthesis and lower sugar content.

4- Leaf Blight:
    Cause: Often caused by the fungus Exserohilum sacchari or similar pathogens.
    Symptoms: Water-soaked spots that turn brown and necrotic. The blight spreads rapidly, affecting the entire leaf.

5- Downy Mildew:
    Cause: Caused by the fungus Peronosclerospora sacchari.
    Symptoms: White to grayish fungal growth on the underside of leaves, with yellowing or browning of the upper leaf surface.
